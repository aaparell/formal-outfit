As a student, it can be challenging to write a resume that stands out and showcases your skills and experiences. In this guide, we will discuss what to put on resume as a student to help you land your dream job or internship.</p><p>As a student, you may not have a lot of work experience or professional achievements to include in your resume. This can make it challenging to showcase your skills and abilities. Additionally, you may not know what employers are looking for in a student resume. These pain points can make the process of creating a student resume overwhelming.</p><p>So, what should you put on your resume as a student? Firstly, you should include your contact information, such as your name, email address, and phone number. This will make it easy for employers to get in touch with you if they are interested in your application. Additionally, you should include a brief summary or objective statement that highlights your skills and what you can bring to the table.</p><p>Next, you should include any relevant coursework, projects, or extracurricular activities that demonstrate your skills and abilities. For example, if you are applying for a marketing internship, you could include a marketing project you completed in a class or a social media campaign you ran for a student organization. Additionally, you should list any relevant skills you have, such as proficiency in a foreign language or experience with a certain software program.</p><p>In summary, when creating a student resume, be sure to include your contact information, a summary or objective statement, relevant coursework, projects, or extracurricular activities, and any relevant skills you have.</p><p><h2>Highlighting Relevant Coursework and Projects</h2></p><p>One of the most challenging aspects of creating a student resume is showcasing your skills and abilities when you don't have much work experience. This is where highlighting relevant coursework and projects can come in handy.</p><p>For example, if you are applying for a job in the finance industry, you could list any finance-related coursework you have completed, such as accounting or financial analysis classes. Additionally, if you have completed any finance projects, such as creating a financial plan for a student organization, be sure to include those as well.</p><p>Highlighting relevant coursework and projects shows employers that you have the skills and knowledge needed for the job, even if you haven't had much professional experience. It also demonstrates your ability to apply what you have learned in the classroom to real-world situations.</p><p><h2>Emphasizing Relevant Skills</h2></p><p>Another way to make your student resume stand out is to emphasize relevant skills. This could include technical skills, such as proficiency in a certain software program, or soft skills, such as communication or leadership abilities.</p><p>To determine which skills to include in your resume, read through the job description carefully and look for any specific skills or qualifications the employer is looking for. For example, if the job requires strong communication skills, be sure to highlight any experiences you have had that demonstrate your ability to communicate effectively.</p><p><h3>Listing Extracurricular Activities</h3></p><p>Extracurricular activities can be a great way to showcase your skills and abilities on your student resume. For example, if you were a member of a debate team, you could highlight your communication and critical thinking skills. If you were a volunteer at a local nonprofit, you could showcase your leadership and teamwork abilities.</p><p>When listing extracurricular activities on your resume, be sure to focus on those that are most relevant to the job or internship you are applying for. Additionally, highlight any leadership roles you held or any specific accomplishments you achieved.</p><p><h4>Formatting Tips for Student Resumes</h4></p><p>When creating your student resume, it's important to keep in mind some formatting tips to ensure that your resume is easy to read and looks professional. Firstly, use a clear and easy-to-read font, such as Times New Roman or Arial. Additionally, use bullet points to break up large blocks of text and make your resume more scannable.</p><p>Finally, be sure to proofread your resume carefully to ensure that there are no spelling or grammar errors. A well-written and error-free resume can make a great first impression on potential employers.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: Should I include my GPA on my student resume?</strong></p><p>A: If your GPA is above a 3.0, it can be beneficial to include it on your resume. However, if your GPA is lower than a 3.0, it may be best to leave it off.</p><p><strong>Q: How long should my student resume be?</strong></p><p>A: Your student resume should be one page or less.</p><p><strong>Q: Should I include references on my student resume?</strong></p><p>A: It's not necessary to include references on your student resume. Instead, you can provide them upon request if an employer asks for them.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I include high school accomplishments on my student resume?</strong></p><p>A: If you are a freshman or sophomore in college, it may be appropriate to include high school accomplishments on your resume. However, if you are a junior or senior, it's best to focus on your college experiences.</p><p><h2>Conclusion of What to Put on Resume as a Student</h2></p><p>Creating a student resume can be challenging, but by following the tips outlined in this guide, you can create a resume that showcases your skills and abilities and helps you land your dream job or internship. Remember to include your contact information, relevant coursework and projects, any relevant skills you have, and any extracurricular activities that demonstrate your abilities. Good luck!</p></article>
