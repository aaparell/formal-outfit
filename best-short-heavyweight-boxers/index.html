Tyson won 50 of his 58 professional fights, with 44 of those wins coming by knockout. He was the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world from 1987 to 1990.</p><p>Another successful short heavyweight boxer is Evander Holyfield.

Short heavyweight boxers need to be able to build their strength and endurance in order to compete at a high level. This means following a rigorous training schedule that includes cardio, strength training, and sparring.</p><p>One example of a fighter who has benefited from rigorous training is Manny Pacquiao. Pacquiao is only 5'5" tall, but he has a reach of 67 inches and weighs around 145 pounds. He is known for his speed and his ability to throw powerful punches. Pacquiao has a record of 62 wins, 7 losses, and 2 draws, with 39 of those wins coming by knockout. He is considered one of the best pound-for-pound boxers of all time, and his training regimen has played a big role in his success.</p><p><h4>How to Become a Successful Short Heavyweight Boxer</h4></p><p>If you are interested in becoming a successful short heavyweight boxer, there are a few key steps that you can take.
