Check with the shop for their specific consignment policies.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Do I have to pay to consign my items?</p><p><b>A:</b> Most consignment shops do not charge a fee to consign items, but they do take a commission from the sale price.</p><p><b>Q:</b> Can I negotiate prices at a men's clothing consignment shop near me?</p><p><b>A:</b> It depends on the shop's policies, but some consignment shops may allow for price negotiation.
