The clogs are made from high-quality leather that is durable and water-resistant. The slip-resistant sole is made from rubber and provides excellent grip on wet floors. The shoes also have a rocker bottom that promotes natural motion and reduces fatigue. However, the shoes may take some time to break in, and they are on the pricier side compared to other options.</p><p><h4>4.

The shoes feature Fresh Foam midsole that provides a plush feel and absorbs shock. The slip-resistant sole is made from rubber and has a herringbone pattern that enhances traction. The shoes also have a synthetic upper that is easy to clean and maintain.
