The company originally operated under the name Wilsdorf and Davis, but it was later changed to Rolex in 1908. Rolex is known for its innovative designs and high-quality watches, which have become synonymous with luxury and style.</p><p><h2>Question and Answer</h2></p><p><strong>Q: What's the difference between an old Rolex watch and a new one?</strong></p><p>A: Old Rolex watches are vintage models that were produced in the past. They often have a different look and feel than modern Rolex watches, and they can be more valuable due to their rarity and history.</p><p><strong>Q: How can I tell if an old Rolex watch is authentic?</strong></p><p>A: The best way to ensure authenticity is to buy from a reputable dealer who can verify the watch's history and authenticity.
