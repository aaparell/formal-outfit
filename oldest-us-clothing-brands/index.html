The brand produces blankets, jackets, and other clothing items made from high-quality wool.</p><p>What sets Pendleton apart is its focus on Native American-inspired designs. The brand has collaborated with Native American tribes over the years to create unique and culturally significant designs.</p><p>Pendleton also places a strong emphasis on sustainability, using eco-friendly materials and implementing sustainable practices in its production process.</p><p><h4>Carhartt: A Closer Look</h4></p><p>Carhartt was founded in 1889 and is known for its durable workwear. The brand's clothing is designed to withstand the toughest of jobs, making it a popular choice among blue-collar workers.</p><p>But what sets Carhartt apart is its commitment to affordability. The brand offers high-quality workwear at an affordable price point, making it accessible to a wide range of customers.</p><p>Carhartt also places a strong emphasis on giving back to the community.
