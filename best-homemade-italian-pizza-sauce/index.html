You can adjust the measurements to your liking based on your preferences.</p><p>The ingredients you will need are:</p><ul><li>1 can (28 ounces) of whole peeled tomatoes</li><li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li><li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li><li>1 teaspoon of salt</li><li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li><li>1 teaspoon of dried oregano</li><li>1 teaspoon of dried basil</li><li>1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (optional)</li></ul><p>Make sure to use high-quality ingredients to get the best flavor possible.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Making the Best Homemade Italian Pizza Sauce</h2><p>Now that you have all the ingredients, let's get started with the step-by-step process of making the best homemade Italian pizza sauce.</p><h3>Step 1: Prep the Tomatoes</h3><p>Start by draining the tomatoes of their juice. You can do this by using a strainer or your hands. Once the juice is drained, crush the tomatoes with your hands or a potato masher until they are in small pieces.</p><h3>Step 2: Cook the Garlic</h3><p>Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook until it becomes fragrant, which should take about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</p><h3>Step 3: Add the Tomatoes and Seasonings</h3><p>Add the crushed tomatoes to the saucepan with the garlic and stir to combine. Add the salt, sugar, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes (if using) to the saucepan and stir until everything is well combined.</p><h3>Step 4: Simmer the Sauce</h3><p>Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for about 15-20 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the sauce from burning. The longer you cook the sauce, the more concentrated the flavor will become.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend the Sauce (Optional)</h3><p>If you prefer a smoother sauce, you can use an immersion blender or transfer the sauce to a blender and blend until it reaches your desired consistency. Be careful not to over-blend the sauce, as it can become too thin.</p><h3>Step 6: Use the Sauce</h3><p>Your homemade Italian pizza sauce is now ready to use! Spread it on your pizza dough and add your favorite toppings.</p><h2>Tips and Tricks for Perfecting Your Homemade Italian Pizza Sauce</h2><p>Here are some tips and tricks to help you perfect your homemade Italian pizza sauce:</p><ul><li>Use high-quality ingredients for the best flavor.</li><li>Adjust the seasonings to your liking. Taste the sauce as you go and add more salt, sugar, or spices as needed.</li><li>Cook the sauce for longer if you prefer a more concentrated flavor.</li><li>Store the sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week, or freeze it for up to three months.</li></ul><h2>Frequently Asked Questions about Homemade Italian Pizza Sauce</h2><h3>Q: Can I use fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can use fresh tomatoes, but you will need to blanch and peel them first. You will also need to adjust the cooking time, as fresh tomatoes have more water content than canned tomatoes.</p><h3>Q: Can I make the sauce ahead of time?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can make the sauce ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator or freezer until you're ready to use it.</p><h3>Q: Can I use dried garlic instead of fresh garlic?</h3><p>A: Fresh garlic will give you the best flavor, but you can use dried garlic if you don't have fresh garlic on hand. Use 1/2 teaspoon of dried garlic for every clove of fresh garlic.</p><h3>Q: Can I use this sauce for other dishes besides pizza?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can use this sauce as a base for pasta dishes or as a dipping sauce for breadsticks.</p><h2>Conclusion of Best Homemade Italian Pizza Sauce</h2><p>Making the best homemade Italian pizza sauce is easy and fun, and it will take your homemade pizza to the next level.
