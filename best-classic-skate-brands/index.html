It has evolved into a lifestyle, and one of the most important aspects of that lifestyle is the gear. Skate shoes, skateboards, and clothing are all necessary elements of the skateboarding world. However, one of the most critical pieces of gear is the skateboard itself, and choosing the right one can be a daunting task. In this article, we will guide you through the best classic skate brands and how to choose the right one for you.</p><p>When it comes to choosing the right skateboard, there are many factors to consider. The type of skateboarding you plan on doing, your skill level, and your personal preferences all play a role in determining which skateboard is right for you. However, one of the most important factors is the brand of the skateboard. Choosing a reputable and reliable brand ensures that you are getting a high-quality product that will last you for years to come.</p><p>In this article, we will discuss some of the best classic skate brands that have stood the test of time. These brands have been around for decades and continue to produce some of the best skateboards on the market. We will also provide tips on how to choose the right skateboard for you and what to look for when shopping for a new board.</p><h2>The Best Classic Skate Brands</h2><p>1. Powell Peralta</p><p>Powell Peralta is one of the most iconic skate brands of all time. Founded in 1978 by George Powell and Stacy Peralta, this brand has been producing high-quality skateboards for over 40 years. Powell Peralta is known for its unique graphics, innovative designs, and high-quality construction. They offer a wide range of boards for all types of skating, from street skating to vert.</p><p>My personal experience with Powell Peralta has been positive. I have ridden several of their boards over the years, and they have always been reliable and durable. The graphics are also a huge plus, as they are always eye-catching and unique.</p><p>2. Santa Cruz</p><p>Santa Cruz is another classic skate brand that has been around since the 1970s. Founded by Rich Novak and Jay Shuirman, this brand is known for its distinctive graphics and high-quality construction. Santa Cruz offers a wide range of boards for all types of skating, from street to vert.</p><p>I have ridden several Santa Cruz boards over the years, and they have always been reliable and consistent.

Vision Skateboards</p><p>Vision Skateboards was founded in the early 1980s and quickly became one of the most popular skate brands of the decade. Known for its wild graphics and innovative designs, Vision Skateboards was at the forefront of the skateboarding world during the 80s. While the brand went out of business in the mid-90s, it was revived in 2010 and continues to produce high-quality skateboards to this day.</p><p>While I personally have not ridden a Vision Skateboard, the brand's reputation speaks for itself. The graphics are always eye-catching and unique, and the quality of the boards is top-notch.</p><h3>How to Choose the Right Skateboard</h3><p>Choosing the right skateboard can be a daunting task, especially if you are new to skateboarding. However, there are a few key factors to consider when shopping for a new board:</p><p>1. Skateboard Size</p><p>The size of your skateboard is an important factor to consider. Larger boards are typically better for cruising and vert skating, while smaller boards are better for street skating and tricks. Make sure to choose a board that is the right size for your body type and skating style.</p><p>2. Skateboard Shape</p><p>The shape of your skateboard is also important. Different shapes are better for different types of skating. For example, a board with a pointed nose and tail is better for street skating, while a board with a wider nose and tail is better for cruising and vert skating.</p><p>3. Skateboard Construction</p><p>The construction of your skateboard is critical. Look for a board that is made from high-quality materials and has a solid construction. A well-constructed board will last longer and perform better than a cheaply made board.</p><h4>Tips for Shopping for a Skateboard</h4><p>When shopping for a skateboard, there are a few tips to keep in mind:</p><p>1. Don't Skimp on Quality</p><p>Skateboarding can be a dangerous sport, so it is essential to invest in a high-quality skateboard. Don't skimp on quality to save a few bucks, as it could end up costing you in the long run.</p><p>2. Check the Reviews</p><p>Before purchasing a skateboard, make sure to check the reviews online. Look for reviews from other skaters to get an idea of the quality and performance of the board.</p><p>3. Try Before You Buy</p><p>If possible, try out a skateboard before you buy it. This will give you a better idea of how it feels and performs, and help you make an informed decision.</p><h2>Question and Answer</h2><p>Q: What is the best size skateboard for a beginner?</p><p>A: For beginners, a skateboard between 7.5 and 8 inches in width is a good place to start. This size is suitable for both street skating and cruising, and is easy to control for beginners.</p><p>Q: What is the best skateboard brand for street skating?</p><p>A: When it comes to street skating, brands like Powell Peralta, Santa Cruz, and Vision Skateboards are all excellent choices. Look for boards with a pointed nose and tail, as these are better for tricks and street skating.</p><p>Q: What is the most durable skateboard brand?</p><p>A: Powell Peralta is known for producing some of the most durable skateboards on the market. Their boards are made from high-quality materials and are built to last.</p><p>Q: What is a good price range for a high-quality skateboard?</p><p>A: A high-quality skateboard can range from $70-$150, depending on the brand and the type of board. While it may seem expensive, investing in a high-quality skateboard is essential for both safety and performance.</p><h2>Conclusion of Best Classic Skate Brands</h2><p>Choosing the right skateboard can be a daunting task, but by choosing a reputable and reliable brand, you can ensure that you are getting a high-quality product that will last you for years to come.
